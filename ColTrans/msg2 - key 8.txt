LONDON HAS FALLEN

THE SEQUEL TO THE WORLDWIDE SMASH HIT "OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN." THE STORY BEGINS IN LONDON, WHERE THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER HAS PASSED AWAY UNDER MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. HIS FUNERAL IS A MUST-ATTEND EVENT FOR LEADERS OF THE WESTERN WORLD. HOWEVER, WHAT STARTS OUT AS THE MOST PROTECTED EVENT ON EARTH TURNS INTO A DEADLY PLOT TO KILL THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL LEADERS, DEVASTATE EVERY KNOWN LANDMARK IN THE BRITISH CAPITAL, AND UNLEASH A TERRIFYING VISION OF THE FUTURE. ONLY THREE PEOPLE HAVE ANY HOPE OF STOPPING IT: THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (AARON ECKHART), HIS FORMIDABLE SECRET SERVICE HEAD (GERARD BUTLER), AND AN ENGLISH MI-6 AGENT WHO RIGHTLY TRUSTS NO ONE.
